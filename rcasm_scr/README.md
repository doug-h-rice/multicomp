## RCASM

An assembler that can be used as well is RCASM.

Found on the COSMAC ELF site, http://www.elf-emulation.com/rcasm.html, I could understand it enought to modifiy it for the SC/MP

It supports Z80 as well.

RCASM
I found an assembler that I could get to understand SC/MP machine code.
http://www.elf-emulation.com/rcasm.html was returning 404 so I added the rcasm. z80.def needs checking.

see: https://github.com/doug-h-rice/RcAsm - forked to add SC/MP 8060.def and update z80.def file.

run make and copy rcasm, rclink and z80.def to parent folder.
